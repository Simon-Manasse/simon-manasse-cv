            <p class=" text-justify">In the first year at HZ University, I learned foundational web development skills including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as TypeScript for building scalable applications. Additionally, I gained proficiency in PHP and Laravel for server-side development and learned about containerization using Docker.
                In the second year, the curriculum expanded to cover advanced topics such as Svelte for building reactive user interfaces, Microservices architecture for developing scalable and resilient applications, and Data Science with Python for analyzing and interpreting large datasets to extract valuable insights.</p>
